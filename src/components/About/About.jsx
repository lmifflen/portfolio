          I am an adventurous, hard working Full Stack Developer and Technical
          Project Manager with a thirst for knowledge. My vision, dedication to
          the task at hand, leadership abilities, and relaxed personality make
          me an excellent member of a team, while my confidence, ingenuity, and
          attention to detail allow me to work comfortably in an independent
          environment. <br></br> <br></br>Undergoing a recent career transition I chose to
          make the move into technology because I want to work on meaningful
          projects that create a positive impact on the world around me.{" "}
          <br></br><br></br>In addition, I enjoyed the technical aspects of my previous
          career as a Geophysicist including mapping using seismic
          interpretation, modelling, and post-stack inversion, database
          management, and using Mathematica. <br></br><br></br> When not working or
          studying I have many extracurricular activities including mountain
          biking, splitboarding, hiking, swimming, camping, traveling and
          working out. <br></br> <br></br>If you have any questions about my credentials
          or have opportunities available please do not hesitate to contact me
          by email at lmifflen@gmail.com.
